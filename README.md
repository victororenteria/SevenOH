# Seven OH

**Seven OH** is a SwiftUI iOS application and widget for logging and tapering usage of 7‑OH tablets.  It provides a simple flow for recording each dose (in milligrams) along with your current mood on a scale from 1 to 10.  The app displays your total intake for the day, visualizes trends over the last week or month, and includes tapering helpers such as daily targets, weekly step‑down plans, progress indicators, reminders and CSV export.  A companion widget allows you to log a dose from your home or lock screen.

## Features

- **Quick logging**: Tap the widget or the Log button to enter a dose amount and mood.  Common doses are provided as quick options.
- **Daily overview**: See how many milligrams you have taken today versus your daily target with a progress ring.
- **Trends charts**: View bar and line charts for the last 7 or 30 days to track total intake and average mood.
- **Tapering assistance**: Configure a daily target, weekly step down (in mg or percentage), and get a forecast of how many days remain until zero.  Reminders can nudge you to log regularly.
- **History and export**: Review your full log history and export it as CSV.
- **Widget and Siri Shortcuts**: A lock screen/home screen widget shows today’s total and a Log Dose button.  An App Shortcut lets you log via Siri.

## Setup

1. Open Xcode 15 or newer and create a new iOS App project named **SevenOH** with SwiftUI and SwiftData.
2. Add a Widget Extension target named **SevenOHWidget**.
3. Enable an App Group for both the app and the widget (for example `group.com.yourcompany.SevenOH`) and update the identifier in `Persistence.swift` accordingly.
4. Add a URL Scheme `sevenoh` to the app target so the widget can open the logging sheet.
5. Replace the contents of the autogenerated targets with the files from this repository.  The Swift files in the root belong to the app target; files in the `Widget` folder belong to the widget target.
6. Build and run on a device.  You can add the widget from the widget gallery.  The quick log actions in the widget open the same logging flow in the app.
